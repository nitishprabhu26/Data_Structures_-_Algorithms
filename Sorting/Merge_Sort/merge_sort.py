# Merge Sort:
# Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves,
# and then merges the two sorted halves.

def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return

    # Finding the mid of the array
    mid = len(arr)//2

    # Dividing the array elements
    L = arr[:mid]

    # into 2 halves
    R = arr[mid:]

    # Sorting the first half
    mergeSort(L)

    # Sorting the second half
    mergeSort(R)

    i = j = k = 0

    # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]

        else:
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1

    # Checking if any element was left
    while i < len(L):
        arr[k] = L[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    while j < len(R):
        arr[k] = R[j]
        j += 1

# Time Complexity: Merge Sort is  Î¸(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.
# Auxiliary Space: O(n)
# Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and Conquer
# Sorting In Place: No in a typical implementation
# Stable: Yes
