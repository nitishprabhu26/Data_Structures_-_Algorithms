# Bubble Sort:
# It is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

# Python program for implementation of Bubble Sort
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):

        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):

            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]


# Optimized Implementation: 
# The above function always runs O(n^2) time even if the array is sorted. It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap. 

# Python3 Optimized implementation of Bubble sort
# An optimized version of Bubble Sort
def bubbleSortOptimized(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False

        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):

            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1. Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True

        # IF no two elements were swapped by inner loop, then break
        if swapped == False:
            break


# Driver code to test above
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

# Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
# Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
# Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
# Sorting In Place: Yes
# Stable: Yes
